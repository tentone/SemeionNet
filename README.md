# SemeionNet

 - A set of machine learning experiments with the semeion and MNIST handwritten digit dataset using  tensorflow

 - The objective of this experiment was to test multiple classification methods using the semeion handwriting dataset and measure performance of different classifiers implementation in tensorflow. 

   

### Dataset
 - The semeion dataset is composed of 1593 handwritten digits from 80 persons that were scanned and stretched to a 16x16 size image.

 - MNIST dataset is a subset of the NIST dataset that has over 60000 handwritten digits.

 - To change the dataset, change the dataset loading code and sample size in the implementation files.
	
 - If you want to you can also import your own dataset, this code can be easily adapted to classify other type of images.
	
```
width = 16
height = 16
dataset = semeion.read_data_semeion()
```

### Install

 - The code available was tested with Python 3.5 and Tensorflow 1.1

 - Before running the examples in the repository, install the dependencies.
	
```
tensorflow matplotlib sklearn pandas numpy
```

â€‹	

### Build and Run
 - Clone the repository into your computer
	- https://github.com/tentone/SemeionNet.git
 - Dataset files are already included in the repository inside the /source/dataset folder.
 - Run one of the implementation files from the source folder, each one implements a diferent classifier.
    	- knn.py, softmax.py, perceptron.py, cnn.py, lstm.py




### Result Comparison
 - The results bellow were obtained, using 1300 random entries from the semeio dataset to train the classifier and 400 random entries to test the trained model.
 - The results obtained are expected, for the recurrent network (long short term memory), i haven't applied any confusion to the input, so after some time it detects that probably the next sample its equal to the current one.
 - Tests were run on a Core i5 6500 CPU with 24GB of RAM.

| Classifier  | Time | Accuracy |
| ----------- | ---- | -------- |
| Softmax     | 40.8 | 94.32%   |
| KNN         | 3.85 | 94.52%   |
| Perceptron  | 11.4 | 97.16%   |
| CNN         | 89.7 | 96.95%   |
| RNN         | 35.1 | 97.56%   |
